'alternative to comment above'
'''
use this for longer block of comments
it can easily comment several lines

# Variables
'''
Drawn on board 
int x = 100 (Java, must declare data type)
x = 100
can put any value in a variable
the value determines the data type
'''
x=100
y=5.5
x='hello'
x=[1,2,3]

# Math operations
# result is always a float
intx=100
inty=10
result=intx/inty
print(result)
# cast result to int
result=int(result)
print(result)

# an alternative is floor division which will discard any remainder
result = intx // inty
print(result)

# math module built in functions
min_val= min(10, 1)
print(min_val)
raised=pow(2,4)
print(raised)
# faster way
raised = 2**4

# loops - for loop and while loop

'''
for loops are traditionally used to iterate through a list of items
In Java and JavaScript they lool like for (int i=0;i<array.length;i++)
Python's for loop does not look like that. There are a few options for the 
for loop.
Here we loop through a range of values starting at 0.
'''
a_list=[10,20,30,40,50]
for i in range(5):
    print(i, a_list[i])

# you can also use the len function to loop through the length of the list
# here we print each item and change the default ending of a new line to a space
# the print function takes an optional parameter, end where we can define how we want
# to separate each item printed.
# items will be printed next to each other instead of on a new line
for i in range(len(a_list)):
    print(a_list[i], end=" ")
print()

# You can also iterate backwards
# first parameter is the start - end of list len(list) -1
# next is where to end the decrement at -1
# next is value to decrement by
for i in range(len(a_list)-1, -1, -1):
    print(a_list[i])

'''
The other option is to use the enumerate function
enumerate takes a list of items and returns the index place and value
and stores them in assigned variables. In this example, it stores the
index place in i and the value in val.
'''
for i, val in enumerate(a_list):
    print(i, val)

# the final most simple loop is like the for each loop in Java
# here each item of the list is assigned to value on each iteration
for value in a_list:
    print(value)

# define a function like this
def hello_world():
    print("Hello World")

# functions with a parameter 
def hello(name):
    print("Hello",name)

# Python functions accept default arguments
def hello1(name="Bob"):
    print("Hello",name)

hello_world()
hello1('Alice')
hello("James")

# Strings are a list of characters
f_name='kathleen'
l_name='malone'
full_name=f_name + " " + l_name

# access characters in a String with an index place
first_char=full_name[0]

# Python has a short cut to access elements starting from the end of the list using negative index places
# This works with any list not just strings
last_letter = full_name[-1]
print(last_letter)
second_last = full_name[-2]
print(second_last)

# Slice a string or a list
# string[start_index:end_index-1]
first_two_chars = full_name[0:2]
print(first_two_chars)
last_two_chars = full_name[-2:]
print(last_two_chars)

f_name=full_name[:8]
l_name=full_name[9:]
print(f_name, l_name)

# Repetition operator, *, will create a string made up of multiple copies of another
python_repeat3 = "python" * 3
print(python_repeat3)
